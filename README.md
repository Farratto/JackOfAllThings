* Adds an action tab to items and spells. Allows for editing spell effects without putting the record onto a character.
* Adds the ability to set actions to items, which will be shown on the character's Action Tab when the item is equipped.
* Adds charges to items. Automated recharging.  Can have items recharged using a die.  Can configure something to happen when the item runs out of charges.
* Adds inventories to NPCs. The primary benefit of this feature at present is to give NPCs items that have Actions.
* Time-based recharge. When used in conjunction with the Clock Adjuster extension, items may be configured to recharge daily at Dawn, Noon, Dusk, or Midnight.

* Automatic Effects data. Leverages data in Automatic effects to automate item recharge configuration for items equipped while using Equipped Effects and Clock Adjuster.
